# Destroy-Castle-game
![](nm639DFOMA.gif)
In this game, the player will be using a slingshot to fire projectiles at a castle, hoping
to demolish it. Each castle will have a goal area that must be touched by the projectile
to continue to the next level.
## The Sequence of Events:
1. When the player’s mouse pointer is in range of the slingshot, the slingshot
should glow.<br/>
2. If the player presses the left mouse button (numbered button 0 in Unity) down
while the slingshot is glowing, a projectile will instantiate at the location of the
mouse pointer.<br/>
3. As the player moves and drags the mouse around with the button held down, the
projectile follows it, yet will remain within the limits of the Sphere Collider on
the slingshot.<br/>
4. A white line will stretch from each arm of the slingshot around the projectile to
make it look more like an actual slingshot.<br/>
5. When the player releases mouse button 0, the projectile will be fired from the
slingshot.<br/>
6. A castle will be set up several meters away; the player’s goal will be to knock
down the castle to hit a target area inside.<br/>
7. The player can fire as many shots as she likes to hit the goal. Each shot will
leave a trail so that the player may better judge her next shot.<br/>
